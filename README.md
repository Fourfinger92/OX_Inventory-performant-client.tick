# OX_Inventory-performant-client.tick
If you want to make your ox_inventory more performant, you can replace the "client.tick" from the client.lua with my version of it.

Tested with version 2.38.1


All love and appreciation goes to overextended, they are making the best inventory for FiveM out there!
